### User Stories Completed

* As a user I should be able to browse the song selection so that I can find sweet beats

* As a user I should land on a splash page for the site so that I have some idea of how to get started
* As a user I should be able to sign in and out of a secure account so that I can keep my payment information, songs, data, etc. safe and private
* As a user I should be able to preview a song so that I can determine whether I like it before I decide to purchase it
